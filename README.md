How to Use These Animations

Integrating these CSS animations into your website is straightforward. Here's a breakdown:

Understanding the Components

Each animation generally consists of two main parts in the CSS:

@keyframes Definition: This block (e.g., @keyframes slideInLeft { ... }) defines the sequence of an animation.

CSS Class Rule: This rule (e.g., .my-element.slide-in-left-anim { ... }) applies the @keyframes. It includes initial styles and the animation property.

Steps to Implement:

Choose an Animation: Use controls to customize. Code snippet updates.

Copy the CSS Code: Includes @keyframes and the CSS class rule.

Example structure:

/* 1. Keyframes Definition */

@keyframes slideInLeft { /* ... */ }

/* 2. CSS Class to Apply */

.your-element.slide-in-left-anim { /* ... */ }

Prepare Your HTML:

<div class="my-cool-box">Animate me!</div>

For "Text Reveal", use a wrapper:

<div class="text-reveal-wrapper">
  
  <p class="my-revealing-text">Revealing!</p>
  
</div>

Apply Animation Class in HTML:

<div class="my-cool-box slide-in-left-anim">I slide!</div>

Add CSS to Your Stylesheet.

Customize Further (Optional).
